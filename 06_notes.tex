\section{TODOS}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Does the network still learn when neurons have a refractory period?
    \item talk about feedback plasticity
    \item investigate exc-inh split biologically
    \item Urbanczik-senn has little empirical background. shits for the outlook
    \item Spiking network as of yet can only process positive-valued input
    \item test time can be reduced by introducing separate t\_pres
\end{itemize}

squared error / variance of training output = explained variance

\subsection{Interneurons and their jobs}




reciprocal inhibition of SST+ neurons. In agreement,
recent experiments show that feedback input can gate
plasticity of the feedforward synapses through VIP+
neuron mediated disinhibition 176 and that pyrami
dal neurons indeed recruit inhibitory populations to
produce a predictive error177 \citep{Poirazi2020}

\subsection{tpres}

$t_{pres} 10 - 50 \tau$
