\section{Somato-dendritic coupling}\label{sec-somato-dendr}

\cite{urbanczik2014learning}, discuss a possible extension to their neuron- and plasticity
model, in which the dendro-somatic coupling transmits voltages in both directions. They show
that the plasticity rule requires only minor adaptations for successfull learning under this paradigm. Yet, as described
by passive cable theory, the flow between neuronal compartments is dictated by their respective membrane capacitances.
These are calculated from their membrane areas, which vastly differ in the case of pyramidal neurons.
