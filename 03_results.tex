\todo{Today, I changed the test criterion from the output neuron voltage at time $t$ to a mean over a sample of the 
last $20ms$, network performance improved tremendously. Intuitively makes sense, but in particular it makes NEST networks 
diverge less after peak performance is reached. Are fluctuations in output layer activity increasing during late stages 
of training?}

\todo{it might be worth experimenting with different synaptic delays in NEST in order to evaluate learning performance 
under biologically plausible transmission times. How easy this will \textbf{assumably} be to implement in NEST deserves 
note at this point.}

\todo{talk about the fact that NEST synapses are updated, and SpikeEvents stored to ring buffers to be integrated into 
$u_som$ after the synaptic delay. How much of physiological synaptic delays occurs pre- and postsynaptically in pyramidal 
neurons?}
