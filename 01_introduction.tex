\section{Motivation}

\todo{fill with citations?}

The outstanding learning capabilities of the human brain have been found to be elusive
and as of yet impossible to replicate in silicio. While the power and utility of classical
Machine-learning solutions has improved greatly in recent years, these approaches can not serve as 
an adequate model of human cognition. 
The sheer number of neurons and synapses in the brain makes simulations
of an entire brain impossible with current hardware constraints. 
In fact, it has been found to be a substantial challenging to
create artificial neural networks that simulate even parts of human neurophysiology while simultaneously being
able to learn in a goal-oriented way. 



The literature entails numerous approaches to adress this challenges, with varying degrees of success. In this thesis,
I will investigate one such approach, and attempt to modify it in a way that it more closely resembles properties 
exhibited by the human neocortex.
